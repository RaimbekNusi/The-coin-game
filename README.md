# "Which Hand" Game

## Description

Very frequently in computer programming we would like to repeat certain actions. Sometimes we want to repeat these actions a specific number of times. Other times, we want to repeat some actions as long as some specified condition (i.e. Boolean expression) is True. Sometimes we’d like to repeat some actions for every element of data in some collection of data elements. In Python, we can do all of these things using loops.

While-loops work a lot like an if-statement in that they have very similar syntax — a condition followed by a block — but the block can be executed multiple times as long as the condition is True. While-loops consist of the word while, followed by a Boolean expression (the loop condition), followed by a colon, followed by a block of code. Below you can see the general form of a while-loop, and the corresponding flow of execution presented as a flowchart.

## Problem description

"Which hand" is a simple game of chance played by 2 people. The game is played in rounds, and the player who wins 3 rounds first wins the game. In each round, one player hides a coin in their palm and asks the other player to guess the correct hand (left or right hand). Then the other player makes a guess and if they get it right, they win a round. If they get it wrong, the other player wins the round. In this version of the game, player 1 always hides the coin and player 2 guesses it.

- Prompt the first player to enter the hand where they want to hide the coin. The player must input "l" for left, or "r" for right in the console.
- Prompt the second player to guess the hand where the coin is hidden. Just like the previous player, player 2 must input "l" for left, or "r" for right in the console.
- The console will ask for inputs until the players enters the correct one ("l" or "r").
- Print the player who wins the round.
- Print the player who wins 3 rounds first
